# Hello!

*Im a developer in development, Computer Technician, and student in Information Systems at UFVJM* <br>
I love to learn new technologies, and discover new things,  mainly about hardware and computer evolution.<br>
I want to be a backend developer, and for this, now I'm studyng nodejs, and in my list are, django and c#, and other related backend technologies, like, spring.

 And Im not a frontend fan... But i can do(not with the better quality), if necessary.
 
 I have interest in knowing the following technologies: 
 *I already have studied the checked ones, this not mean I'm proficient at all*
 

 - [x] C++
 - [x] Javascript
 - [x] Java
 - [x] Node.js
 - [x] React.js
 - [ ] NEXT.js
 - [ ] C#
 - [ ] python
 - [ ] Rust
 - [ ] GO


My currently working projects focus on the programming logic, and enphasize the knowledge in the stack that i need to learn : 
## Ac Dash and FT:

Ac Dash is a backend to Asseto Corsa API, to capture the data and provide in an websocket, to use in custom dashboards, one of example is FT, an dashboard made to training my css skills, using the Fueltech's dashboard as an example. Is planned to end this one this year, upgrading the data backend and making a better front-end.
## aluracord_react:

repository created during one of the ReactJS Immersion from Alura's. hosted on vercel, is incomplete, and i want to finish in some time.
## ant_colony & antColony-sdl:

My try to implement simulation of Ant colony optimization, using c++ and javascript, currently incomplete. It's paused to focus in another works.
## binaryTree:

Implementation of an binary tree, part of my AEDSIII homework.

## Blog Backend:

My most complex project, planned to be open source in the future, the main purpose is for training Typescript, but I added much complexity in the starting of the project, wich made it harder to implement considering the time I have to put in this. 
## calculator:

My first public repository, made in 2020 during the pandemics. For pessoal reasons I don't like this repo. I make this and stopped coding for more than a year, and i don't agree with this decision. But is a part of my history, like my first calendar written in css, js and html.

## Clock: 

Analog clock, just for training my Js skills. Sometimes I come back to this repo when i have new ideas of improvements.

## cmdrend:

A project of an cmd renderer, to use in some projects. I pretend implement when i learn the linear algebra background to make it better.

## deadline:

OS class job sequencing problem implementation. Finished.

## ins_sort:

Implementation of Insertion Sort Algorithim, part of my AEDS II homework.

## Lanchonete:

Final Job for the OOP class in the university, the final job has more documents than are present in this repo, I want to solve this problems and fix that in some time.

## LanguageConvergence and vervets-sdl:

 As a part of an college work in the Artificial Intelligence class, is an implementation of the vervet's collective intelligence. Just the final results, more info in the repository readme. Was made 2 times, once in Javascript, with repository name LanguageConvergence, that was incomplete and just a proof-of-concept, and another in c++, that was made with SDL2, with repository name vervets-sdl..  

## Morse-key:

A morse manipulator, used during my morse studies, it's simple but useful in the time I made it. Needs some improvements, like, better front-end, real-time translator, and morse automatic encoder. 

## Project1memfill:

Just fill your computer memory, just for fun, try to run. 

## repositoryEx & DAOxREPO:

Two example repositories to use in an task from the OOP Seminar. It's finished because it served for his purpose. The ideas from this project are in use in another projects.

## sorveteria-BD:

This project was made in the DB class in the university, it's the implementation of some concepts, and written in NodeJS and React. More informations in repository Readme, currently, is planned to implement more funcionalities and refactor the code.

## trabalho_LP:

Programming languages class final task. Business Rules included in repository Readme. Built in javascript. Improvements are planned to the current year.

## uniform_cost:

Implementation of Uniform Cost Search for a known problem, part of the AI class homework.

## Vacation Timer:

A custom Timer, made during my 2023 pre-vacation-week, just for fun, planning to reuse this repo every year. also can be used as an multi-proposal timer.
